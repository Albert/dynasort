I just started working on 23rd street and happened by Mozzarellis by chance. Stopped in and saw they had gluten free pizza, gluten free desserts and gluten free cookies. They had a nice selection of gluten free pizza on the counter. I counted 5 gluten free pizzas, with various gluten free toppings. Since being diagnosed with Celiac I have not eaten pizza, so imagine the shock of seeing gluten free pizza all mine for the taking. Seeing all those gluten free pizza slices made me drool like a little puppy. I ordered one gluten free pizza slice to try. No doubt this gluten free pizza tasted awesome and much better than expected. I ate three more gluten free slices and called it a day. I have been back to Mozzarellis for their gluten free pizza at least 3 x a week. Mozzarellis has delicious gluten free cheesecake and amazing gluten free cookies. I met the chef on one visit and he was truly passionate about gluten free pizza and gluten free cooking. Anyway, I love the gluten free pizza at Mozzarellis. My whole office eats there and we order pizza every Friday, with one gluten free pizza for yours truly.

Maffei! Maffei Pizza is basically an institution for those working around the Ladies Mile and Chelsea. On the corner of 22nd and 6th, it is not meant for a sit down lunch (and thank goodness for that). Lunch is an organized, choreographed chaos kept at bay by Dominick's baritone offering combinations of pasta, salad, fish and what-have-you at a pace only an auctioneer can match. Portions are VERY generous, and if you like fried calamari, better make it before 1:30 pm. Everything is good... The pizza, well, is fantastic NY Style. Great sauce with just the right amount of cheese. The Grandma pizza is one of their specialties, and is true heaven. Always fresh; the turnover and clientele at lunch makes sure that happens. No attitude, no brick oven, no fu-fu ingredients. Just great pizza for real New Yorkers. So hide your i-phone, say hi to Dom and get yerself fed. NY Style.

The pizzeria is a local shop frequented by the diverse community around the Christopher Street area. It is run by a friendly bunch of Egyptian guys who make some of the best pizza I have tasted in a while. The pizza is very tasty. The crust is thin(but not too thin), and the sauce is salty and spicy(not sweet like most pizza sauces). They have a variety of Italian specialties, but made with a Middle Eastern twist. Calzones, Spaghetti, and Italian hot dog rolls, you name it. They even have Jamaican style beef patties! An assortment of bottled, and fountain drinks is also available. If you want a cool treat, they have old fashioned Italian ices in an assortment of flavors. The space is rather bland, and sometimes the local youth seem to get a bit rowdy, but not often enough to detract from the awesome food. It is definitely a casual place to meet with 'down to earth' friends and just kick back and chat while enjoying a nice slice of pizza."},"Distance":"1.29","Url":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-11069201-rivoli-pizza-new-york","ClickUrl":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-11069201-rivoli-pizza-new-york","MapUrl":"http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?q1=125+Christopher+St+New+York+NY&gid1=11069201","Categories":{"Category":[{"id":"96926234","content":"Carry Out & Take Out"},{"id":"96926236","content":"Restaurants"},{"id":"96926243","content":"Pizza"}]}},{"id":"11060218","Title":"Pasta Presto MacDougal","Address":"93 Macdougal St","City":"New York","State":"NY","Phone":"(212) 260-5679","Latitude":"40.729398","Longitude":"-74.001201","Rating":{"AverageRating":"5","TotalRatings":"3","TotalReviews":"2","LastReviewDate":"1249688399","LastReviewIntro":"great place service great food amazing location perfect for a summer night have dinner and stroll afterwards"},"Distance":"1.07","Url":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-11060218-pasta-presto-macdougal-new-york","ClickUrl":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-11060218-pasta-presto-macdougal-new-york","MapUrl":"http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?q1=93+Macdougal+St+New+York+NY&gid1=11060218","Categories":{"Category":[{"id":"96926179","content":"Seafood Restaurants"},{"id":"96926190","content":"Italian Restaurants"},{"id":"96926236","content":"Restaurants"},{"id":"96926238","content":"Sandwiches"},{"id":"96926243","content":"Pizza"}]}},{"id":"11112039","Title":"Pizza Park","Address":"1233 1st Ave","City":"New York","State":"NY","Phone":"(212) 879-6444","Latitude":"40.764446","Longitude":"-73.958649","Rating":{"AverageRating":"4","TotalRatings":"5","TotalReviews":"3","LastReviewDate":"1262148304","LastReviewIntro":"My favorite place to get pizza in New York.

The place was very crowded, and I didn't realize it was as large as it was. It had two full floors. Usually you just see this place included in a food court at the mall. You walk around and pick out what you want. They have plenty of choices of pizzas and pastas, etc. Not knowing they had pizza, I picked out a bowl of lasagna. After seeing the pizza, I also grabbed a slice of pizza. Laura just had pizza. Once we paid for our food, here came the dilemma. The only available places to eat were downstairs. We trudged, carrying our plates of food, down quite a long flight of stairs. It was a trip. When we got downstairs, we found a table and proceeded to eat our lunch. The food was mediocre at best. Typical of food that's been laying around for a while.

For those into more healthful eating, there are tons of selections, and they offer a baby carrot side option for those not into chips. Of their soups, the Chicken Noodle is my favorite, and if you order a bowl vs. a cup they'll serve it up with several pieces of their fresh bread (almost a lavosh - it's truly excellent.)

I've been eating NYC pizza for 40 years, and La Pizzeria gets an \"average\" rating from me. I find the pizza to be somewhat greasy. The cheese and the overall taste are just ok. I can't imagine calling this place amongst the best in the city. No way. Real NYC pizza must be at least better than Dominos. And this place isn't significantly better than Dominos. One thing La Pizzeria has going for it is a dearth of competition in the area. There is a pretty good sit-down thin crust restaurant nearby.

I went on a corporate lunch, but would have been equally pleased as a casual imbiber after 5. Had the Penne Jambalaya, which I was curious about (since this is an Irish pub...), and it was pleasantly serviceable, as was the Corned Beef sandwiches and Caesar salad my cohorts enjoyed. Service was fast and \"just right\", without too much or too little involvement from the waitstaff. I felt good, leaving a $20 tip on a $70 lunch, and I will certainly make this my Midtown hangout, at least on those days when I find myself there with either a hunger for good food or a thirst for a cold pint o' Guinness.
