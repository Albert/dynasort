After 40 minutes walked in to check again, we were told that he was sitting reservations first and did not know how long it would be. My wife and I had our cousin and 7 year old nephew out of town who's nuts about sushi. We were looking forward to this meal all day and had bitter sushi at the end. Next time I would walk in, ask for phone number, call, make reservation in front of them and come back at the time I specified - it should be more reliable according to their rules. But I am never going back, probably better for both them and us. I can't believe I am still bitter about it... usually I am not... sorry. I would not have said anything if it wasn't for my nephew."},"Distance":"2.38","Url":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-21373494-sushi-bistro-san-francisco","ClickUrl":"http://local.yahoo.com/info-21373494-sushi-bistro-san-francisco","MapUrl":"http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?q1=455+Balboa+St+San+Francisco+CA&gid1=21373494","BusinessUrl":"http://www.sushibistrosf.com/","BusinessClickUrl":"http://www.sushibistrosf.com/","Categories":{"Category":[{"id":"96926205","content":"Sushi Restaurants"},{"id":"96926210","content":"Japanese Restaurants"}]}},{"id":"21332684","Title":"Sushi Zone","Address":"1815 Market St, #5","City":"San Francisco","State":"CA","Phone":"(415) 621-1114","Latitude":"37.771427","Longitude":"-122.42366","Rating":{"AverageRating":"4.5","TotalRatings":"18","TotalReviews":"13","LastReviewDate":"1223973662","LastReviewIntro":"great fish, watch the glass! and call ahead!

It is pretty popular so you may have to wait if you get there past 8. I found even with three chefs, the service was a little slow. On the plus side, they have a reasonable deal on saki bombs, like I said it is a hip joint, and one of the chefs is a dead ringer for Ichiro Suzuki! Not sure if thats a good thing or not. Anyway, try it for yourself, If you don't think the sushi is spectacular, I would say find a better place for your money.
